        <button class = "accordion">What is a trademark?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, a trademark can be any word, phrase, symbol, design, or a combination of these things that identifies your goods or services. Trademarks are often used to protect a company's brand, preventing others from using it for their own profit.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Why is transparency about trademarks important?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The purpose of this website is to provide the general public, especially new business owners, information about the logos, designs, phrases, and words individuals and companies are trying to file. Transparency about trademarks and trademark applications is important because it allows entrepreneurs to know what they can and can't
            put in their products.</p>
          <p>This website makes these open records more accessible to people who don't know where to look for this specific information. We also want to dispel common misconceptions about trademarks. </p>

        <button class="accordion">What are some common misconceptions about trademarks?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>A common misconception about trademarks is the idea that someone can legally own a word. This is false because trademarks are tied to the usage of a good or service. An exception is when a trademarked word becomes the common word for describing a specific product or service.</p>
        <p>For example, the word "popsicle" is actually trademarked by Unilever, resulting in conflicts over the use of the word.
